# Tally_Banquet_Easy_Project
This project is designed to extract booking data from the Banquet Easy website and generate an XML file that can be imported directly into Tally Prime.  The PHP script will allow you to pull booking information such as sales, receipts, and ledgers within a specified date range and create a well-structured XML file.
